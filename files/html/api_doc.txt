API doc	


There are currentlty 4 basic functions:  Read, write, switch, and button.  The read, write, and switch functions simply perform the function and output a reply in JSON.

READ FUNCTION
	INPUT parameters:
	io		the GPIO address to use (generally 0-3)

	OUTPUT reply parameters:
	changed		boolean, always "false"/0 for "read")
	io		confirms the IO from the input
	state		boolean, 1 for "on" and 0 for "off"
	nextstate	boolean, should be the opposite of the current state.

	EXAMPLES:

WRITE FUNCTION
	INPUT parameters:
	io		the GPIO address to use (generally 0-3)
	value		the new value to write (blank, "_", or omit for equivelant to "read")

	OUTPUT reply parameters:
	changed		boolean, indicates if this function caused a change or if the previous state remained 
	io		confirms the IO from the input
	state		boolean, 1 for "on" and 0 for "off"
	nextstate	boolean, should be the opposite of the current state.

	EXAMPLES:
	/api.php?io=3&op=write&value=0	(turn off GPIO 3)
	/api.php?io=0&op=write&value=1	(turn on GPIO 0)


SWITCH FUNCTION
	INPUT parameters:
	io		the GPIO address to use (generally 0-3)

	OUTPUT reply parameters:
	changed		boolean, should always show "true" / 1 for "switch"
	io		confirms the IO from the input
	state		boolean, 1 for "on" and 0 for "off"
	nextstate	boolean, should be the opposite of the current state.

	EXAMPLES:
	/api.php?io=2&op=switch	(refreshing this over and over should continually switch the state of GPIO 2 every time)

BUTTON FUNCTION
	INPUT parameters:
	OUTPUT reply parameters:
